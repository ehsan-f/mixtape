\title{Apply training tile cutoffs to a new dataset}
\usage{
mix_apply_tiles(prob, tile_breaks)
}
\arguments{
\item{prob}{Numeric vector of model probabilities to bin}

\item{tile_breaks}{Break points from training data, typically from \code{model_metrics$tiles$tile_breaks}}
}
\value{
Integer vector of tile assignments (1 = lowest, n = highest)
}
\description{
Assigns tiles to a probability vector using the breakpoints derived from the
training dataset. Use this to consistently tile any scored dataset (e.g.
production scoring runs) with the same thresholds used during model evaluation.
