  excl_features = NULL,

  use_neg_bal_features = F,
  use_amount_based_features = T,

}
\arguments{
\item{df_train}{Data frame. Training dataset with target variable and features}

\item{df_features}{Data frame. Feature metadata with columns: variable, variable_group,
neg_bal_feature, feature_measure}

\item{excl_features}{Character vector. Features to exclude manually}

\item{excl_features_regex}{Character. Regex pattern to exclude features}

\item{use_neg_bal_features}{Logical. Include negative balance features? Default: FALSE}

\item{use_amount_based_features}{Logical. Include amount-based features? Default: TRUE}

\item{grouped_selection}{Logical. Use grouped selection (top N per group)?
If FALSE, uses gain/frequency thresholds. Default: TRUE}

\item{group_features_n}{Integer. Number of top features to select per group
when grouped_selection = TRUE. Default: 5}

\item{target_var}{Character. Name of binary target variable. Default: "t_bad_y"}

\item{max_cores}{Integer. Maximum cores for parallel processing. Default: NULL
(tries ls_config$parallel$max_cores, falls back to detectCores() - 2)}
}
\value{
List with:
\itemize{
\item ds_selected_features: Selected features with importance scores
\item v_important_features: Vector of selected feature names
\item ds_importance: All features with importance scores
\item model_auc: Training AUC of initial model
}
}
\description{
Performs feature selection using XGBoost importance scores. Trains an initial
model and selects features based on gain/frequency thresholds or grouped selection.

# Basic usage with grouped selection
results <- mix_ml_feature_selection(df_train, df_features)

# Threshold-based selection

# Exclude specific features
results <- mix_ml_feature_selection(df_train, df_features,
