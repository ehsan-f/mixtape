\title{Create training index}
\usage{
mix_train_index(df, target = "t_", p = 0.7, group = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame to add index to}

\item{target}{Name of the target variable column for stratified sampling (default: 't_')}

\item{p}{Proportion of data to use for training (default: 0.7)}

\item{group}{Optional column name for group-level splitting (e.g., 'user_id').
When provided, stratification is done on a group-level "ever bad" flag (max of target per group),
and all rows for a group are assigned to the same split.}
}
\description{
Creates a stratified train_index column using caret's createDataPartition.
Optionally splits at the group level (e.g., by user_id) to prevent the same
group from appearing in both train and test sets.
}
